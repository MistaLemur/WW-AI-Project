# WW-AI-Project
WumpusWorld AI Project

This is my final project entry for an Intro to AI class.
My code is only the code within the MAI folders, and the MyAI.cpp and MyAI.hpp.
Two versions of my AI can be found here; MAI1 and MAI2. These behave very differently from one another; MAI2 scores much higher than MAI1 does, since MAI2 implements a more efficient algorithm.

The WumpusWorld environment (World.cpp, World.hpp, Agent.hpp, etc...) was provided by the professor.

Test worlds are provided under the Debug build folder.
A makefile is provided under Wumpus_World_Cpp_Shell; run the makefile using the make command.

After building using the make file, run the executable using the following commands:
-f Worlds     //This will run the AI on all of the test worlds and print out performance statistics and score
-d            //This will run the AI and show it step-by-step so that you can watch the AI solve the scenario
